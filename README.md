# How to run locally on a Mac

1.  Clone or download this repository
2.  Open terminal
3.  Install homebrew if you haven't already using the instructions here https://brew.sh/
4.  Install node by running `brew install node` in the terminal
5.  Navigate to the repository in the terminal using a command like: `cd /root/to/where/you/put/the/repository/fibonacci-rolls`
6.  Run `npm install` to install the app's dependencies
7.  Run `npm start` then go to http://localhost:3000/ in the browser and the app should be running
8.  You can then make changes to the code and the running app will be automatically updated. I recommend using an IDE like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to work on the code

# Code Strucure

The main two files to look at are `src/App.jsx` and `src/App.css`

`src/App.jsx` contains the logic and the layout of the content

`src/App.css` contains the styling of the app

I have added comments to try to explain what is going on in these files, please ask if you have any questions!
